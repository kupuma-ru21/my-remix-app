Same
I'm not sure about a difference between `<Form>` and `fetcher.Form`

> [There is one key difference though, it's not a navigation, so the URL doesn't change and the history stack is unaffected.](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/tutorial#forms-without-navigation)

In other words, `<Form>` changes something of URL and history stack
but I couldn't find any change in my environment
What do the docs mean?
